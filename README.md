# **Oldagram**

# Overview

Welcome to Oldgram! ðŸ“· This project mimics Instagram but in a more static version. The layout is simple, featuring the project name on the top left side and the author's photo on the right. The main content includes profiles of three different famous persons: Vincent van Gogh, Gustave Courbet, and Joseph Ducreux. Each profile showcases a small picture of the artist along with their name and place of origin. Below the profile details, there is an image created by each artist, accompanied by three icons - a heart, a comment, and a forward icon. The number of likes and a comment made by the author about the picture are displayed below these icons. Clicking on the heart icon increments the number of likes by one, although the heart icon remains unfilled. Additionally, hovering over the image turns it grey.
